Judicial space
Regarding space,
Bruno Dayez carries out a topographical analysis of the trial which allows us to highlight several characteristics:
First, "the trial takes place in a defined, unchanging and closed place: the courtroom ", which is itself located within the courthouse, which at first glance makes us think of an imposing and austere temple where we have the impression that we are not necessarily welcome and that there is it's not good to live, while for my part, I can assure you that we have very good times.
Therefore, the place where the trial takes place is separate from the ordinary world, "the justice is a particular, autonomous operation that requires its detachment from the everyday world. "
