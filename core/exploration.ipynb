    "Judicial space\n",
    "Regarding space,\n",
    "Bruno Dayez carries out a topographical analysis of the trial which allows us to\n",
    "highlight several characteristics:\n",
    "First, \"the trial takes place in a defined, unchanging and closed place: the\n",
    "courtroom \", which is itself located within the courthouse, which\n",
    "at first glance makes us think of an imposing and austere temple where we have\n",
    "the impression that we are not necessarily welcome and that there is\n",
    "it's not good to live, while for my part, I can assure you that we have\n",
    "very good times.\n",
    "Therefore, the place where the trial takes place is separate from the ordinary world, \"the\n",
    "justice is a particular, autonomous operation that requires its\n",
    "detachment from the everyday world. \"\n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore a space separated from the secular space of the city.\n",
    "Regarding the publicity of the audiences, these cannot be filmed\n",
    "and disseminated (except for trials of historical interest by\n",
    "example). When the trial takes place at the last instance, it must\n",
    "putting a definitive end to the conflict is what sets it apart from\n",
    "the gear of private revenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, imagine it is broadcast on television, it would be subject to\n",
    "recurrent manner in democratic debate, which would be an obstacle to its\n",
    "essential function of social pacification: \"Res judicata pro veritate\n",
    "habetur, \"the saying goes,\" Res judicata is held to be truth. \"\n",
    "So \"except for the few palate rats baited by the smell of\n",
    "sentence \", of which I am a part, are present at the hearing only those who\n",
    "are summoned to appear there. And it is the press that delivers the only echo of what is happening\n",
    "weft within the walls of the palace.\n",
    "Then, concerning the interior space of the trial, it is divided into\n",
    "regions.\n",
    "Each speaker occupies a limited space, it defines the status\n",
    "even of the speaker, the precise role he must fulfill. \"It is forbidden to\n",
    "put in the place of others because this substitution would risk throwing the\n",
    "confusion in the artificial world of the trial. \"\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the auditorium, the courtroom has two differentiated spaces, the separation of which\n",
    "can be materialized by a barrier, a rope or simply a\n",
    "empty space. One, with benches, is for the public and the other for the stage\n",
    "judicial proper.\n",
    "The space is organized symmetrically on either side of the president,\n",
    "whose chair is often slightly raised. The president is surrounded\n",
    "assessors. Then, at the ends, we find the clerk on one side and the\n",
    "the public prosecutor of the other (or the attorney general if the case falls within the jurisdiction of the seats).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in general, the public prosecutor is at the same level as the court.\n",
    "The question then arises of the balance of power in the spatial organization of the\n",
    "trial and in particular the asymmetrical position of the prosecutor and the lawyer\n",
    "in relation to the judge. This geographical proximity between the prosecutor and the\n",
    "judge could lead one to believe that the rights of the defense and the necessities of\n",
    "repression are not on an equal footing. And finally, always separated\n",
    "of the public, is the bar where witnesses come to testify, \"the past in\n",
    "flashback \" to use the good word of Master Verg√®s. And then, on both sides\n",
    "on the other hand, the benches reserved for the accused and his lawyer are distributed, and those\n",
    "reserved for the victim and his lawyer. \"The compartmentalisation of the actors\n",
    "therefore already freezes in the personification of an action: accusing, defending, judging\n",
    "or be judged. \"\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also add that in addition to the very precise function assigned to each\n",
    "actor, the dress, that is to say the dressing, also makes it possible to better identify\n",
    "the various protagonists of the judicial scene.\n",
    "Antoine Garapon assigns him three main functions. A first\n",
    "function of purification, it purifies the ordinary person before this one\n",
    "exercise its institutional role. Here too, there is a desire to mark the\n",
    "break between life and trial. Then, it aims to protect the\n",
    "person who is about to perform the function which is proper to him, in him\n",
    "conferring a feeling of superiority which will release it from violence\n",
    "legitimate which it is called upon to exercise. And finally, it allows to signify the\n",
    "victory of the appearing over the being, of the character over the person, of\n",
    "the institution on the person. Antoine Garapon says it very rightly: \"the dress\n",
    "allows, for the wearer, identification with his character.\n",
    "Contrary to the saying, in the trial it is the dress that makes the judge,\n",
    "the lawyer and the prosecutor.\"\n",
