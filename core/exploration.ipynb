    "Judicial space\n",
    "Regarding space,\n",
    "Bruno Dayez carries out a topographical analysis of the trial which allows us to highlight several characteristics:\n",
    "First, \"the trial takes place in a defined, unchanging and closed place: the courtroom \", which is itself located within the courthouse, which at first glance makes us think of an imposing and austere temple where we have the impression that we are not necessarily welcome and that there is it's not good to live, while for my part, I can assure you that we have very good times.\n",
    "Therefore, the place where the trial takes place is separate from the ordinary world, \"the justice is a particular, autonomous operation that requires its detachment from the everyday world. \"\n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore a space separated from the secular space of the city.\n",
    "Regarding the publicity of the audiences, these cannot be filmed\n",
    "and disseminated (except for trials of historical interest by\n",
    "example). When the trial takes place at the last instance, it must\n",
    "putting a definitive end to the conflict is what sets it apart from\n",
    "the gear of private revenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, imagine it is broadcast on television, it would be subject to\n",
    "recurrent manner in democratic debate, which would be an obstacle to its\n",
    "essential function of social pacification: \"Res judicata pro veritate\n",
    "habetur, \"the saying goes,\" Res judicata is held to be truth. \"\n",
    "So \"except for the few palate rats baited by the smell of\n",
    "sentence \", of which I am a part, are present at the hearing only those who\n",
    "are summoned to appear there. And it is the press that delivers the only echo of what is happening\n",
    "weft within the walls of the palace.\n",
    "Then, concerning the interior space of the trial, it is divided into\n",
    "regions.\n",
    "Each speaker occupies a limited space, it defines the status\n",
    "even of the speaker, the precise role he must fulfill. \"It is forbidden to\n",
    "put in the place of others because this substitution would risk throwing the\n",
    "confusion in the artificial world of the trial. \"\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the auditorium, the courtroom has two differentiated spaces, the separation of which\n",
    "can be materialized by a barrier, a rope or simply a\n",
    "empty space. One, with benches, is for the public and the other for the stage\n",
    "judicial proper.\n",
    "The space is organized symmetrically on either side of the president,\n",
    "whose chair is often slightly raised. The president is surrounded\n",
    "assessors. Then, at the ends, we find the clerk on one side and the\n",
    "the public prosecutor of the other (or the attorney general if the case falls within the jurisdiction of the seats).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in general, the public prosecutor is at the same level as the court.\n",
    "The question then arises of the balance of power in the spatial organization of the\n",
    "trial and in particular the asymmetrical position of the prosecutor and the lawyer\n",
    "in relation to the judge. This geographical proximity between the prosecutor and the\n",
    "judge could lead one to believe that the rights of the defense and the necessities of\n",
    "repression are not on an equal footing. And finally, always separated\n",
    "of the public, is the bar where witnesses come to testify, \"the past in\n",
    "flashback \" to use the good word of Master Vergès. And then, on both sides\n",
    "on the other hand, the benches reserved for the accused and his lawyer are distributed, and those\n",
    "reserved for the victim and his lawyer. \"The compartmentalisation of the actors\n",
    "therefore already freezes in the personification of an action: accusing, defending, judging\n",
    "or be judged. \"\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also add that in addition to the very precise function assigned to each\n",
    "actor, the dress, that is to say the dressing, also makes it possible to better identify\n",
    "the various protagonists of the judicial scene.\n",
    "Antoine Garapon assigns him three main functions. A first\n",
    "function of purification, it purifies the ordinary person before this one\n",
    "exercise its institutional role. Here too, there is a desire to mark the\n",
    "break between life and trial. Then, it aims to protect the\n",
    "person who is about to perform the function which is proper to him, in him\n",
    "conferring a feeling of superiority which will release it from violence\n",
    "legitimate which it is called upon to exercise. And finally, it allows to signify the\n",
    "victory of the appearing over the being, of the character over the person, of\n",
    "the institution on the person. Antoine Garapon says it very rightly: \"the dress\n",
    "allows, for the wearer, identification with his character.\n",
    "Contrary to the saying, in the trial it is the dress that makes the judge,\n",
    "the lawyer and the prosecutor.\"\n",

For 150 years two mighty space powers have intermittently warred with each other: the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance.\n",
    "Within the Galactic Empire, based on mid 19th century Prussia, an ambitious military genius, Reinhard von Müsel, later conferred Reinhard von Lohengramm, is rising to power. He is driven by the desire to free his sister Annerose, who was taken by the Kaiser as a concubine. Later, he wants not only to end the corrupt Goldenbaum dynasty but also to defeat the Free Planets Alliance and to unify the whole galaxy under his rule.\n",
    "In the Free Planets Alliance Star Fleet is another genius, Yang Wen Li. He originally aspired to become a historian through a military academy, and joined the tactical division only out of need for tuition money. He was rapidly promoted to an admiral because he demonstrated excellence in military strategy in a number of decisive battles and conflicts. He becomes the archrival of Reinhard, though they highly respect one another. Unlike Reinhard he is better known for his underdog victories and accomplishments in overcoming seemingly impossible odds and mitigating casualties and damages due to military operations.\n",
    "As a historian, Yang often predicts the motives behind his enemies and narrates the rich history of his world and comments on it. One of his famous quotes is: “There are few wars between good and evil; most are between one good and another good.”\n",
    "Besides the two main heroes, the story is full of vivid characters and intricate politics. All types of characters, from high nobility, admirals and politicians, to common soldiers and farmers, are interwoven into the story. The story frequently switches away from the main heroes to the Unknown Soldier fighting for his life on the battlefield.\n",
    "There is a third neutral power nominally attached to the Galactic Empire called the Phezzan Dominion, a planet-state (city-state on a galactic scale) which trades with both warring powers. There is also a Terraism cult, which claims that humans should go back to Earth, gaining popularity throughout the galaxy. Throughout the story executive political figures of Phezzan in concert with the upper-hierarchy of the Terraism cult orchestrate a number of conspiracies to shift the tide of the galactic war so that it may favor their objectives.\n",

    "The main advantage of this approach is that it uses the tokenization directly from the transformers tokenizer instead of an external tokenizer like NLTK. Keep in mind that most transformer models use different sub-word tokenizers, while NLTK probably uses a word-level tokenizer (see explanation here). This means that NLTK will split a string like “I have a new GPU!” into 6 tokens (one per word + punctuation), while e.g. BERT’s tokenizer will split it into 7 (['i', 'have', 'a', 'new', 'gp', '##u', '!']), because it splits rare words into sub-words (e.g. GPU). With the “pure transformers” approach you can be sure to really get the exact maximum number of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantage is that there is no sentence boundary detection. You can theoretically solve that with the NLTK (or SpaCy) approach and splitting sentences. But the token threshold should probably be set below 1024 words (maybe 900?), because 1024 NLTK word tokens translate into more than 1024++ sub-word tokens. Otherwise, the text gets truncated again and you effectively delete parts of your text.\n",
    "\n",
    "I feel like summarising texts above 1024 tokens is probably a common use case and enabling this kind of “long text summarisation” could be a very useful feature for the summarisation pipeline. Could this maybe be something that could be added to the pipeline with e.g. a keyword argument like ‘summarise_long_text=True’?\n",
